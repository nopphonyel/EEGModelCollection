# About this Repo
This repo will contain some of Neural network models which design for EEG specific task. All of model in here are implemented on pytorch since my lab prefer this framework and I beleive that there are many implementation on TensorFlow or Keras already.

# Getting start
## Requirements
These codes require these packages below 
```
torch
numpy
```

## Download the code
1. Change to your project directory.
2. Clone this repo using command 
    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/nopphonyel/EEGModelCollection.git
     ```

## Import code
1. To import the model, simply add the code below on the top of your python file.
    ```python 
    from EEGModelCollection import <Your component>
    ```
